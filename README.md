# Vue ToDo App


Created a simple toDo app to learn more about vue.js.

This app can track various todo items and allows users to edit the items once created, as well as mark as "done", and finally, delete them entirely.

The app can keep track of items even post "refresh" and will continue to remember the users name.

App is also styled with a templeted CSS doc.
